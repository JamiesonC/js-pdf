js-pdf
======

JavaScript library for generating PDFs.

This library was originally designed to support a standalone client HTML application that needed to generate PDF invoices. It supports basic page, text and line definitions, which are passed into the generator as a JSON object. (Spec and example to come.) It outputs PDF-1.0 in 7-bit ASCII (uncompressed).
